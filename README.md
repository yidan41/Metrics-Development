Explore methods for developing new performance metrics with limited data

__Summary of auto-mpg project__

In this analytics project, I cleaned and explored the dataset with visualizations and statistics. Based on the requirement of a good performance metric and knowledge about auto industry, I designed the score metric as: 
Score = a * rank_mpg + b * rank_acce + c * rank_weight
